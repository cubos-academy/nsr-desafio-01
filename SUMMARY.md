## üöß Challenges Faced

During the development of the NasaApoImages bot, we encountered several challenges, including:

- Integrating with the NASA and Telegram APIs to ensure smooth communication and data retrieval.
- Ensuring the continuous polling for updates from Telegram and processing the latest messages.
- Managing the complexities of handling various user commands and requests.
- Managing and maintaining the codebase and ensuring code quality and best practices.

## üîú Upcoming Features

Please note that some of the required features are still under development. These include:

- Sending the APOD image daily to each bot subscriber.
- Adding the ability to filter images based on specific dates.

## üîß Custom API Clients

Both the NASA API client and the Telegram API client were developed from scratch without using any plug-and-play libraries. This approach allowed to have complete control over the functionalities and tailor the clients to our specific needs.
